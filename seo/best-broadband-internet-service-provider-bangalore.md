There are numerous broadband service providers in Bangalore. Listing some of the good providers that you should check out in order of preference. 

### 1. ACT Broadband

They are the best in terms of speed & budget. Their plans are extremely competitive. Their support is also by far one of the best that you could get. 

The problem is the areas they cover. They have to increase their coverage a lot. The first thing you should is to check if ACT broadband provides connection in your area & grab them if they do.

### 2. Airtel

Some providers are good in terms of coverage. Some providers are extremely budget friendly plans. Some providers have pretty good after installation service. Coverage wise, Airtel has maximum coverage. But the problem is, they usually have slots full & hence unable to provide new connection.

If you are new in the location, you should first check with Airtel if they can provide you a connection. Their plans are decent, although not the best you could get. But since there are lot of new players keep coming in the market, they constantly revise their plans. Their customer support is again decent, but not the best. 

### 3. Spectranet

Spectranet is another good provider in Bangalore. But they provide internet only in big apartments. If you are one of the big apartment guys, you do not have much of a choice, as your apartment association would have blocked most of the providers & would have allowed for select few. If Spectranet is one of them, prefer them over any other provider. 


### Others

There are a lot of other providers, both big & small. Tata Docomo is big but probably ok. 

Tikona has some sporadic coverage as they are the WiMax provider. They will not put a dedicated line, but will install a small receptor antenna on top of your building/balcony. They also provide a demo where they will come, quickly setup their antenna & show your the speed that you are getting. They are pretty quick to setup. But their support has been pretty bad. 

Avoid You broadband at all cost. There is nobody out there who is happy with their connection. 

### Shameless promotion

If you are in Bangalore for short time, have pretty minimal needs of browsing (you do not hog videos on youtube), its painful spending time getting a new internet connection. Imagine, if you could have used internet of one of your neighbour & shared some cost with them. We started Griggi with exactly this intent. Check our [home page](/) for more info. 

If you are in Bangalore for long term & yet to buy a router, you could try buying a router from us. Apart from letting you share your spare data, Griggi router comes with [OpenWrt](https://openwrt.org) pre-installed. Openwrt is one of the best opensource router OS out there. There are plethora of cool packages that you could install on your router. You can read more about openwrt on this [makeuseof article](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/what-is-openwrt-and-why-should-i-use-it-for-my-router/)

You could try installing Openwrt on a router yourself. Get a Openwrt compatible router (they start as low as Rs 1000, google for TP-Link-TL-WR740N), flash Openwrt & then you would be able to do one step Griggi install on it. 

If you want to save the hassle, we will do all the installation & ship the router to you at cost price. Let us know by emailing at **griggi@googlegroups.com** & we will get back ASAP.
