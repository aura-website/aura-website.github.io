For business, sharing WiFi has been an expensive affair with people selling all kind of 'solutions' & charging hefty money. The tech involved is pretty straight forward & we at Griggi feel that someone has to **standardize** the process & bring down the cost.

## Griggi Advantages

**1. Miniscule cost** - There are no 'recurring' cost with Griggi. You just need to pay one time router cost. We even discount that if you have more than 100 users using Griggi every month.

**2. Abuse control** - You can specify total data shared every month & the WiFi sharing will be disabled once that quota is hit. You can also specify per user quota (total quota / expected users) & each user who surpass his quota will no longer be able to use WiFi for that month. Most WiFi owners keep *extremely slow/annoying speed* to prevent abuse but you do not have to. 

**3. No sharing password** - Griggi provides an **open WiFi** to which only Griggi registered users can connect. A new user can register with Griggi by connecting to your Griggi WiFi. Dont worry, we have built-in abuse control & open WiFi does not mean WiFi up for abuse. 

**4. User data monitoring** - We do a book keeping of every user. Users need to register with their mobile phone number so they can be tracked. This is in accordance with Indian laws for WiFi sharing. 

**5. Extremely user friendly** - We have built innovative ways to ensure your users have a great experience using your WiFi. They get to see the speed they are getting upfront, their data quota etc. Details on [our home page](/)

## Who could use Griggi

Through Griggi, anybody could share their WiFi with people around either for free or for a price. **You need to have a broadband connection.** 

### Cafe/restaurant owners

**1. Get Griggi** by [filling in this form](#form). If you already have a free WiFi solution, you could still try Griggi by placing Griggi router alongside your regular router.

**2. Configure WiFi quota** per billing cycle. Assuming you have 100 GB data & you expecting 100 users, you could provision 1 GB per user. Assuming, you would like to keep 10 GB for your internal work like billing, specify 900 MB of data per user.

**3. Put our WiFi powered by Griggi standee** to let your users know that you have got free WiFi. 

**4. Users connect to your WiFi.** They need to be registered with Griggi. They can complete the step through your WiFi connection itself so that they dont get singled out. 

#### Optional Settings

**5. Sell some of your data** to hardcore users who have exceeded their quota & want to buy more. You could put a price for your data beyond the free quota, something like Rs 100 per extra 100 MB. Users could top up his account from his Griggi dashboard.

**6. Redeem accumulated paid data** at end of every month through your Griggi dashboard. Eg. if total accumulated paid data in your account is 5 GB, you can redeem it for Rs 5k as you had put Rs 100 per 100 MB data. 

### Coworking space owners

The steps are same as that of cafe/restaurant owner except that you probably do not want to provision for free WiFi. You may like to specify only paid quota & no free WiFi quota. You could aim at your users who come in for a day or two or probably just couple of hours. 

Assuming you have Rs 300 per day pass & if you think a user typically would consume 100 MB of internet in a day, put a price of Rs 300 for 100 MB data. The approach has following advantages :-

* Nobody has to do a book keeping of your non-regular users
* Your non-regular users wont feel like they are being watched for the time they are spending at your place.
* No payment collection hassle. They top up their account from their Griggi dashboard & you redeem their used internet data with us at end of every month.
