title: How to get the max speed out of WiFi access points/routers
excerpt: Get the best speed by following these steps.

Using a simple and free app called "WiFi Analyzer" you can tune your WiFi channel for better speed.

Open this app and it will show you the channels and signal strength of all nearby WiFi routers.


WiFi routers have a setting called **WiFi channel**.

Different channels ensure that nearby routers do not interfere with one another.

This problem is more pronounced in 2.4Ghz WiFi compared to 5Ghz, because 5Ghz has lot many non-interference channels available.

For 2.4Ghz (WiFi4) most appropriate values is either 1, 6 or 11. Because only these 3 values are non-interfering with each other.

For 5Ghz there are lot many channels available. So no need to do anything. 


Ensure that you get the 3 non-intersecting domes in your premise as seen below by selecting either of 1,6,11 channel numbers. 

Try to get as close to IDEAL as possible by following this on all your WiFi APs/routers.

This can make difference between 2 Mpbs and 70 Mbps.


#### IDEAL ####

Notice how cleanly non-intersecting all 3 domes are.

#### BAD ####

There is no dome at all due to all intersecting channels.
