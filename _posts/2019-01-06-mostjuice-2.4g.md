title: How to get the max speed out of 2.4Ghz access points
excerpt: You may still have quite a few old WiFi access points. Get the best out of them by following these steps.
---

Your WiFi AP/router has a setting call **wifi channel**. 

Ensure that you get the 3 non-intersecting domes as seen below by selecting either of 1,6,11 channel numbers. Unfortunately by default all APs have set this to auto which causes interference with other channels.

This can make difference between 2 Mpbs and 70 Mbps.
