title: Basics of a WiFi hotspot
---
WiFi has made internet sharing incredibly easy. Earlier one would have to run an Ethernet cable to each computer, which was inconvenient and routers had limited number of ports (typically 4 to 8).
WiFi routers have no limitations on number of users. The signal reach is pretty wide if it is unobstructed. This makes it ideal for a LAN for the private use, or for ad-hoc internet sharing with a guest, or to a stranger for a contribution towards the broadband cost.


#The security issue:

However there are guidelines to be followed while providing internet connection to a stranger. The law everywhere demands that you need to get the digital identity of the user. This requires setting up an authentication server where a user has to first create login by providing her mobile number. 
This requirement puts a huge burden on common WiFi owners to share internet with their neighbors lawfully. If home WiFi owners were to be encouraged to open their network, there has to be an automated way to setup the authentication server.
