** Internship in sales **

About the Internship:
At Griggi, we have created a unique WiFi hotspot solution that let cafe/hotel owner to be able to control data allocation to their users thus preventing the internet data abuse. It also makes the WiFi hotspot TRAI compliant by making sure that the user connecting to the WiFi gets an OTP on his phone before he could start using. This is similar to how the WiFi is at Airport & prominent cafes like Starbucks.
The solution is currently live at Toit in Indranagar & couple of other small locations in Bangalore. The sales cycle for Griggi is just 15 min pitch & demo if you are able to reach the decision maker. So finding the connect to the decision maker / owner of the establishment is important.
As part of the internship, the selected candidate need to:
> 1. Make a list of prominent cafes & pubs in Bangalore. Try to find contact of the owner of the cafe or pub by researching his profile on Linkedin or guessing his email. Drop him a cold email or phone call explaining the product.
> 2. Schedule an on-premise demo. Post demo, monitor the installation (it is simply a plug & play kind of solution but some wiring needs to be done to make sure the WiFi researches everywhere & there are no dead zones).
> 3. Being innovative in lead generation. Try to find out other avenues where these owners hang out at & publicize Griggi there. Figure out ways to have more incoming leads + doing a one on one outgoing sales.
