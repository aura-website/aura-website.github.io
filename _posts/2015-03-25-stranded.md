title: Stranded without internet

The unimaginable horror had happened. I was going to have no broadband access for a week. The place I was put up at didnâ€™t have broadband connection of its own. I could see many WiFI SSIDs getting broadcasted from neighbors; all password-protected and no easy way to contact the owners. I would have paid for the usage, had there been a way to pay & connect.

I felt there should be an easy and automated way to share a connection over WiFi. It should also have a way to collect payment from the itinerant user.
Over next few days I discussed this among a few friends brainstormed to find a solution for this. Many use cases came up of such a setup.

* A  community of users who share their broadband for free among members. 
* WiFi owners in tourist, commercial districts for pay & use.
* Cafes looking to setup free/paid WiFi hotspot  for customers.
