As every co-working space owner knows, keeping the damn WiFi running isn't exactly a piece of cake.

I have helped manage some of them and here are the top reasons, in the order of importance:

## 1. You don't have a fail-over system

Best of the ISPs go down at least once a week. If internet is critical for you, getting a backup ISP connection from a different provider makes lot of sense
But then one primary + one backup is all you need. A third ISP is rarely required. 
Also get a multi-WAN router, it will automatically handle individual ISP outages and provide seamless internet to users.
A brief note on multi-wan router is here : 

## 2. Your WiFi routers are not optimally placed

Most people don't get how flaky wireless connections can be. 
You have to be within 20 meters to mask the noise out and have reliable internet.
With 5G the range has further come down.

## 3. You have no internet monitoring system in place
Power loss, loose cable, accidental and intentional resets, ISP throttling, it all adds up.
A monitoring system will give you a live status of every network element and will tell you if anything is OFF.

## 3. You don't have enough ISP bandwidth

While it depends how much each user is accessing, on average 2 Mbps per user is OK in office settings. 
In a long term stay or home settings itâ€™s 5 Mbps per user. 

## 5. You have no usage limits in place

I run through about 500 GB of data per month, if I am not careful about my usage.
