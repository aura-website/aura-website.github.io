As every co-working space owner knows, keeping the damn WiFi running isn't exactly a piece of cake.

I have helped manage some of them and here are the top reasons, in the order of importance:

## 1. You don't have a multi-ISP system

Best of the ISPs go down at least once a week. Once used only in "enterprise", multi-WAN is a basic necessity in 2019.
A multi-WAN router will automatically handle individual ISP outages and provide seamless internet to users.

## 2. Your WiFi routers are not optimally placed

Most people don't get how flaky wireless connections can be. 
You have to be within 20 meters to mask the noise out and have reliable internet.
With 5G the range has further come down.

## 3. You have no internet monitoring system in place
Power loss, loose cable, accidental and intentional resets, ISP throttling, it all adds up.
A monitoring system will give you a live status of every network element and will tell you if anything is OFF.

## 3. You don't have enough ISP bandwidth

While it depends how much each user is accessing, on average 2 Mbps per user is OK. That means a 100Mbps connection is good for 50 users in office settings. Probably more

## 5. You have no usage limits in place

I run through about 500 GB of data per month, if I am not careful about my usage.
